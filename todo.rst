Implement:

1. pre-order, postorder and in-order class iterators
2. Implement versions that use stacks

Finish code to accurate set the recursion depth for ~bstree() and ~Node(), or use the debugger to follow the ~Node() calls to see how deep the recursion goes.

Read up on measuring recursion in Carrano, Droznek, and see `Time Complexity of Resursive Algorithms: The Master Theorem <https://yourbasic.org/algorithms/time-complexity-recursive-functions/>`_
